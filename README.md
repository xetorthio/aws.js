# aws.js

aws.js is a dead simple and sane Amazon Web Services client for node.js

aws.js is very simple to use and do only the most basic stuff for you: signing the request and converting XML to a usable data structure.

## How do I install it?

Install it as an npm package

```bash
npm install aws.js
```

## How do I use it?

```javascript
var client = aws.createClient('secret_access_key', 'aws_access_key_id', 'ec2.amazonaws.com');
var signature = client.run('/', 'RunInstances', {'ImageId':'ami-60a54009', 'MaxCount':3, 'MinCount':1, 'Placement.AvailabilityZone':'us-east-1b', 'Monitoring.Enabled':'true'}, function(response) {
    console.log('Everything is OK. Here is what amazon API returned:');
    console.log(response);
}, function(error) {
    console.log('There is an error:');
    console.log(error);
});

```

For more usage examples check the tests.

## I want to contribute!

That is great! Just fork the project in github. Create a topic branch, write some code, and add some tests for your new code.

To run the tests use mocha.

Thanks for helping!
